# Developer Guide

## Prerequisite

You need to have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) and [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org) installed and available in your terminal.

## Set up the development environment

To set up a development environment for Rail Map Painter, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/railmapgen/rmp.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd rmp
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will open the application in your default web browser, and it will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source code.
