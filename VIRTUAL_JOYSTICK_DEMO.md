# Virtual Joystick Implementation for Rail Map Painter

## Overview
The virtual joystick has been successfully implemented for the Rail Map Painter touch overlay to help mobile users move selected nodes without needing to precisely touch small elements.

## Features Implemented
- **4 Directional Buttons**: Up, Down, Left, Right - each moves selected nodes by 10px
- **Copy Button**: Exports selected nodes and edges to clipboard
- **Delete Button**: Removes selected nodes and edges from the graph
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only appears when nodes are selected (`selected.size > 0`)
- **Responsive Positioning**: Centers at bottom of the SVG viewport
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large button targets with semi-transparent design

## Code Structure
- `src/components/touch/virtual-joystick.tsx` - Main joystick component
- `src/components/touch/touch-overlay.tsx` - Integration point
- Uses existing Redux state (`selected`) and movement logic from keyboard controls

## Button Functions
- **Up Arrow**: Moves selected nodes up by 10px  
- **Down Arrow**: Moves selected nodes down by 10px
- **Left Arrow**: Moves selected nodes left by 10px
- **Right Arrow**: Moves selected nodes right by 10px
- **Copy Icon**: Copies selected elements to clipboard (same as Ctrl+C)
- **Delete Icon**: Removes selected elements (same as Delete key)

## Implementation Details
- Uses React icons from `react-icons/md` for consistent UI
- Follows existing movement patterns from keyboard controls (i/j/k/l keys)
- Integrates with existing clipboard and deletion functionality
- Positions relative to SVG viewport for proper scaling
- Uses `onPointerDown` events for touch compatibility

## Testing
- Unit tests verify component rendering based on selection state
- Tests confirm proper positioning calculations
- Validated that buttons only appear when nodes are selected

## Next Steps
The virtual joystick is ready for use. The main integration point is complete, and it will automatically appear when users select nodes on touch devices, providing an intuitive way to move elements around the canvas.
